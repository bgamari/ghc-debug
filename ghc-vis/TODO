- Tests to detect when GHC changes in a way that makes ghc-vis unusable

- Getting a reconstructed type as a String from GHCi would be enough?

- return $ MVarClosure itbl (ptrs !! 0) (ptrs !! 1) (ptrs !! 2)
  in HeapView sometimes fails at (ptrs !! 0) (primes example with byte-code)

- Sometimes random hangs in ghc-vis?

- Check if pdf, png, svg, ps support in cairo activated at all, seems to be weird
